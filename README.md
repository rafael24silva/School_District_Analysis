# Analysis of Grades for the School Board
## Overview of the School District Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to remove the reading and math scores for Thomas High School due to academic dishonesty and to see what changes that brings forth to the previously calculated numbers. We would be recalculating the averages and percentages of passes and seeing if there are any changes in the overall picture.
## Results
Let us first look at the results before the altered changes:

* Due to the removal of the ninth graders', the overall, math, and reading percentages went up tremendously for Thomas High School, no other schools saw any changes because we only removed student scores from Thomas High School.
* Given the enormous size of our dataset, there were no significant changes to the district analysis, below there will be a screenshot of the new district analysis.

* The removal of the ninth-grade scores have done the following:
  * There are no longer math and reading scores by grade for the ninth-grade of Thomas High School.
  * No notable changes to the scores by school spending
  * No notable changes to the scores by school size
  * No notable changes to the scores by school type
## Summary
Given how large our dataset is, there were really not any notable changes to highlight. The biggest highlight was the tremendous increase in the reading, math, and overall percentage of students that passed in Thomas High School. It seems that there were many students who did not pass in the ninth grade and this may have caused our data to be skewed. Given that the students were still counted in some parts of the data, there were no changes to be seen with school spending, size, or type. The biggest changes were in the scores of the students at Thomas High School.
